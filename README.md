# GWA-calculator

## Overview 
-The goal of our code is to make a calculator that computes a student’s General Weighted Average(GWA) based on subject grades and corresponding units.
you enter grades + units for each subject, and the program does the calculations for you. 

## Features
-We created a calculator which will compute a student’s General Weighted Average or G.W.A based on the grades of their subjects and its corresponding units
-It supports Python 3.8 and newer versions
-Will displays a student’s G.W.A based on the user’s data for their grades and corresponding units
- It supports when the user enters multiple subjects along with their grades and corresponding units
- Automatically computes the weighted average
- Rounds up the final GWA to 2 decimal places
- Checks input to guarantee correct numerical entries 
- Allows repeated use of the program without shutting down
## Requirements
- Python 3.8+  

## How to Run
1. Download or clone this repository
2. Open terminal or command prompt
3. Navigate to the project folder
4. Run:

## Sample Run
Enter subject grade (or 'done' to finish): 1.5
Enter subject units: 3
Enter subject grade (or 'done' to finish): 2.0
Enter subject units: 4
Enter subject grade (or 'done' to finish): 1.75
Enter subject units: 3
Enter subject grade (or 'done' to finish): done

Your General Weighted Average (GWA) is: 1.78
Classification: Dean's Lister
